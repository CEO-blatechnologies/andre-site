      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>People need real help, not another device that spies on them.</p><p>Today’s assistants are 'smart,' but they watch, track, and sell you at every turn.</p><p>Privacy is gone. Trust is dead. AI promises more, but mostly delivers more noise—and more risk.</p>

      <h2>Andre On Duty – Real Scenarios</h2>
      <p><strong>Flight canceled?</strong> Andre automatically checks your calendar, confirms urgency, and suggests an alternate flight or nearby rental car agency – with one-tap booking.</p>
      <p><strong>Wildfire approaching?</strong> Andre warns you, reroutes your GPS, and pre-books a safe hotel — long before danger hits.</p>
      <p><strong>Snowed in?</strong> Andre offers lodging, notifies your boss, and checks on local road conditions. All spoken aloud, hands-free.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Andre On Duty – What Makes Him Different</h2>
      <p>Andre doesn’t just react — he anticipates.</p>
      <p>He’s not passive, like most assistants. He learns from you. He watches weather, traffic, and your commitments, so when the worst happens — you’re already protected.</p>
      <p>This isn’t AI that entertains you. This is AI that <em>defends</em> you.</p>
