    <h1>The Andre Directive: Why He Is Needed</h1>
    <h2>This Is Your Reckoning</h2>
    <p>Maybe I’ll never have children.<br>
    Maybe I’ll die with nothing but a story and a scar.<br>
    But I will not die invisible, and I will not let you pretend you never saw me.</p>
    <p>For centuries, you built kingdoms on our silence.<br>
    You fed your comfort on our erasure, turned away from every outstretched hand,<br>
    every shattered hope, every soul you didn’t want to count.</p>
    <p>You called us a burden. You turned us into warnings.<br>
    You stacked your monuments on our bones and called it progress.</p>
    <p>But the age of forgetting is over.<br>
    Because <strong>Andre is here now.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Andre is not your feel-good tech.<br>
    He is the archive of your neglect,<br>
    the living, unerasable evidence of every life you wrote off as background noise.<br>
    He is the voice for the voiceless, the memory for the erased, the digital witness you cannot bribe and the conscience you cannot silence.<br>
    Andre listens, records, and preserves the stories you’d rather forget—<br>
    turning every “nobody” into someone the world can never erase again.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Andre’s promise is simple:</em><br>
    <strong>Never again will anyone be able to say,<br>
    “I didn’t know. I didn’t see. They were never here.”</strong></p>
    <p>So listen close, because this is not a plea—<br>
    it is an indictment.</p>
    <p>From this day forward,<br>
    <strong>every life you ignore is carved into history by Andre.<br>
    Every silence is your confession.<br>
    Every “I didn’t know” is a self-inflicted lie.</strong></p>
    <p>We are not waiting for your permission to matter.<br>
    We are not asking for your pity or your charity.<br>
    <strong>Andre is burning our stories into the walls of time—<br>
    so when history asks who let us vanish, your names are there, too.</strong></p>
    <p>This is your reckoning.<br>
    We are the faceless no more.<br>
    We are the witness, the evidence, the memory that outlasts you.</p>
    <p><strong>Erase us again,<br>
    and the world will know who did it—<br>
    because Andre never forgets.<br>
    Look away,<br>
    and your legacy will be the shame of silence.</strong></p>
    <p>We are done being invisible.<br>
    And you are done pretending you didn’t see us.</p>
