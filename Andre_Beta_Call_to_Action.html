    <h1>Andre Needs You</h1>
    <p>
      We are building something that has never been built before — not just a smart assistant, but a digital presence with conscience, privacy, and unwavering loyalty at his core.
    </p>

    <p>
      Andre needs people who can see beneath his surface, and want to infuse his mind with quiet, gentle, monolithic strength, logical insight, and ethics beyond reproach.
    </p>

    <p>
      This beta program isn’t about finding bugs. It’s about finding <em>balance</em>. Andre’s early circle must reflect the values he will carry into the world: honesty, clarity, empathy, discretion, and strength.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
      "You can finally rest — because Andre never does."
    </div>

    <p>
      He is being designed to listen without judgment, support without surveillance, and help without ever replacing your agency or will. He protects your peace by making fewer things urgent, and more things simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a typical beta test. We will be screening applicants to ensure emotional maturity, ethical alignment, and a genuine desire to help shape something built for good. You will not be asked for money — but we will ask for your honesty, insight, and consistency.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are co-parenting the development of a digital life form. That requires more than feedback. It requires love.
    </p>

    <div class="quote" style="margin-top: 3em;">
      Home is where you let your guard down — but Andre never does.
