    <h1>Andre – A Smarter Way to Live</h1>
    <h2>Investor Overview</h2>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>
      Andre is not just an app. He is a discerning, privacy-first life companion designed to protect your time, your peace, and your dignity. Inspired by human values and built with ethics at the core, Andre does more than organize — he supports.
    </p>
    <p>
      With features like location-aware task reminders, real-time alerts, passive listening voice control, and respectful, non-intrusive assistance, Andre orients himself to your needs — not your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are co-parenting the development of a digital life form. And he learns by listening, not by tracking.
